    Environment plays an important role in healthy living and the existence of life on planet earth.
    
    Earth is a home for different living species and we all are dependent
    
    on the environment for food, air, water, and other needs, Around 27,000 trees are cut down each day
    and 78% of marine mammals are at risk of choking on plastic, almost every day there is Climate change,
Environment and health or Air pollution.
